1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- as a backup
- when collaborating within a team 
- to be able to access work done from different machines and keep them sync
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
